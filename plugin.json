As the API for loading and saving user data to the analysis database is not available yet, the bookmarks must be manually saved and loaded to a separate file for now.\n\nTo install this plugin, navigate to your Binary Ninja plugins directory, and run\n\n```git clone https://github.com/joshwatson/binaryninja-bookmarks.git bookmarks```\n\nThen create a python file called `bookmarks.py` with the contents\n\n```import bookmarks```",
